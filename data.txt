Machine Learning, often abbreviated as ML, is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the development of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience and by the use of data. In simpler terms, machine learning enables computers to learn from data and make decisions or predictions without being explicitly programmed to do so.

At its core, machine learning is all about creating and implementing algorithms that facilitate these decisions and predictions. These algorithms are designed to improve their performance over time, becoming more accurate and effective as they process more data.

In traditional programming, a computer follows a set of predefined instructions to perform a task. However, in machine learning, the computer is given a set of examples (data) and a task to perform, but it's up to the computer to figure out how to accomplish the task based on the examples it's given.

For instance, if we want a computer to recognize images of cats, we don't provide it with specific instructions on what a cat looks like. Instead, we give it thousands of images of cats and let the machine learning algorithm figure out the common patterns and features that define a cat. Over time, as the algorithm processes more images, it gets better at recognizing cats, even when presented with images it has never seen before.

This ability to learn from data and improve over time makes machine learning incredibly powerful and versatile. It's the driving force behind many of the technological advancements we see today, from voice assistants and recommendation systems to self-driving cars and predictive analytics.

Machine learning vs AI vs deep learning
Machine learning is often confused with artificial intelligence or deep learning. Let's take a look at how these terms differ from one another. For a more in-depth look, check out our comparison guides on AI vs machine learning and machine learning vs deep learning. 

AI refers to the development of programs that behave intelligently and mimic human intelligence through a set of algorithms. The field focuses on three skills: learning, reasoning, and self-correction to obtain maximum efficiency. AI can refer to either machine learning-based programs or even explicitly programmed computer programs.

Machine learning is a subset of AI, which uses algorithms that learn from data to make predictions. These predictions can be generated through supervised learning, where algorithms learn patterns from existing data, or unsupervised learning, where they discover general patterns in data. ML models can predict numerical values based on historical data, categorize events as true or false, and cluster data points based on commonalities.

Deep learning, on the other hand, is a subfield of machine learning dealing with algorithms based essentially on multi-layered artificial neural networks (ANN) that are inspired by the structure of the human brain.

Unlike conventional machine learning algorithms, deep learning algorithms are less linear, more complex, and hierarchical, capable of learning from enormous amounts of data, and able to produce highly accurate results. Language translation, image recognition, and personalized medicines are some examples of deep learning applications.
